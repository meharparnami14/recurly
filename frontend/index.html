    <h2>
      Subscriptions are easy to start.<br />
      Hard to keep track of.
    </h2>

    <p>
      Most people are paying for more than they realize.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recurring charges stack up silently, month after month often without notice.
      Missed renewals, forgotten trials, and overlapping services make spending
      harder to control.
    </p>

    <p>
      Visibility is the first step to taking your money back.

    <h2>Recurly fixes that.</h2>

    <p>
      One dashboard for every subscription.
      Know what you pay, when it renews,
      and where your money goes.
